## Hi there 👋

I'm Eric.  I work in the software industry as an SDET, writing code for our CI/CD and automated UI tests, squashing bugs, and upgrading quality controls.  Lately I've been navigating the parabolic world of AI with a healthy dose of optimism, a good pinch of skepticism, and plenty of elbow grease!

As a voracious reader, **InkLeaf** is my small passion project - a utility for collecting quotes (or "leaves", as I call them) that doubles as a playground for experimenting with my favorite agentic tool, **Claude Code**. 

AI has eliminated the coding barrier that once gatekept software.  The key differentiator among competitors will be products that excel in offering superior quality. This new world is extremely energizing for me. 

A bit more about me:
- 🔭 I’m currently working on **InkLeaf**
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **agentic workflows and leveraging LLMs to make QA more accessible to non-specialists**
- 📫 If you want to chat, reach out at **eric@ericbrock.net** and let's talk!
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not reading 📖, you can find me in my apiary 🐝 or taking photographs 📸
